    "Errors detected during Python program execution are called *exceptions*. Many standard exceptions are built into Python, they form an inheritance hierarchy. The base class for all built-in exceptions is `BaseException`. The most common exception is `Exception`. From the `Exception` class, many other exception classes are derived, such as:\n",
    "* `ValueError` - when a function receives an argument of the correct type, but with an inappropriate value,\n",
    "* `TypeError` - when a function receives an argument of an inappropriate type,\n",
    "* `NameError` - when a local or global name is not found,\n",
    "* `IndexError` - when a sequence subscript is out of range,\n",
    "* `KeyError` - when a dictionary key is not found,\n",
    "* `ZeroDivisionError` - when division or modulo by zero is attempted,\n",
    "* `FileNotFoundError` - when a file or directory is requested but doesn't exist,\n",

    "## Handling exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be handled using the `try` statement. The most basic form of the `try` statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except <exception>:\n",
    "    # code that handles the exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try` statement works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code block within the `try` statement is executed.\n",
    "2. If no exception occurs, the `except` block is skipped and the `try` statement is finished.\n",
    "3. If an exception occurs during the execution of the `try` block, the rest of the block is skipped. Then, if the exception type matches the exception named after the `except` keyword, the code block following the `except` keyword is executed. If the exception type does not match, it is passed to higher level of the stack. If no handler is found, the exception is an *unhandled exception* and the program stops with an error message.\n",
