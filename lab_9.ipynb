    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Python standard library [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a class, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. The class body is indented. The class body can contain method definitions, data attributes, and other class definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class <class name>:\n",
    "    <statement-1>\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    <statement-N>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest class definition is an empty class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> class MyClass:\n",
    "...     pass\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The only use of a class is to create instances of it. To create an instance of a class, call the class object as if it were a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = MyClass()\n",
    ">>> x\n",
    "<__main__.MyClass object at 0x7f3c5c2d3b50>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class. All objects created from the same class share the same structure (the same attributes and methods), but they they are separate entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = MyClass()\n",
    ">>> y = MyClass()\n",
    ">>> x is y # x and y are different objects (different things in memory)\n",
    "False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. There are two types of attributes: class attributes and instance attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class attributes are shared by all instances of a class. They are defined within the class definition but outside any methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> class MyClass:\n",
    "...     class_attribute = 42\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> x = MyClass()\n",
    ">>> y = MyClass()\n",
    ">>> x.class_attribute\n",
    "42\n",
    ">>> y.class_attribute\n",
    "42\n",
    ">>> MyClass.class_attribute\n",
    "42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance attributes are unique to each instance. They are typically defined within the methods of a class, but they can be also defined by assigning to an instance attribute outside any method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> class MyClass:\n",
    "...     class_attribute = 42\n",
    "...     \n",
    ">>> x = MyClass()\n",
    ">>> y = MyClass()\n",
    ">>> x.instance_attribute = 43\n",
    ">>> x.instance_attribute\n",
    "43\n",
    ">>> y.instance_attribute\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "AttributeError: 'MyClass' object has no attribute 'instance_attribute'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to define the behaviors of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> class MyClass:\n",
    "...     def method(self):\n",
    "...         return 'Hello, world!'\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> x = MyClass()\n",
    ">>> x.method()\n",
    "'Hello, world!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class. It does not have to be named `self`, but it is a very strong convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> class MyClass:\n",
    "...     def method(self):\n",
    "...         return self\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> x = MyClass()\n",
    ">>> x.method()\n",
    "<__main__.MyClass object at 0x7f3c5c2d3b50>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More figuratively, let `MyClass` be a class with a method `method()` with some parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> class MyClass:\n",
    "...     ...\n",
    "...     def method(self, ...):\n",
    "...         ...\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the call `x.method(...)`, where `x` is an instance of `MyClass`, is equivalent to `MyClass.method(x, ...)`. The `self` parameter is a reference to the instance `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a class `Person` with two instance attributes: `name` and `age`, and a method `greet()` that returns a greeting message.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def person(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        return f'Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can create instances of the class `Person` and call the method `greet()` on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> alice = Person()\n",
    ">>> alice.person('Alice', 25)\n",
    ">>> alice.greet()\n",
    "'Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.'\n",
    ">>> bob = Person()\n",
    ">>> bob.person('Bob', 30)\n",
    ">>> bob.greet()\n",
    "'Hello, my name is Bob and I am 30 years old.'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`alice` and `bob` are separate instances of the same blueprint, the class `Person`. They have separate attributes `name` and `age` and same method `greet()`, which has access to the attributes of the instance it is called on.\n",

    "### `__init__` method\n",
    "\n",
    "In many previous examples, we had to define a method `initialize()` to initialize the instance attributes. It was necessary, because sometimes objects need to be initialized with some values. This is a common pattern, so Python provides a special method `__init__` that is called automatically when an object is created. The `__init__` method is called an *initializer*. It is an optional method, and it should be defined wheneever the object needs to be initialized with some values.\n",
