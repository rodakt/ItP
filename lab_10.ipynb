    "### Special methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Special methods, also known as **magic methods** or **dunder methods**, are a set of predefined methods in Python that allow you to customize the behavior of your classes in various ways. They are recognized by their double underscores (`__`) at the beginning and end of their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are invoked by Python's interpreter under certain circumstances, such as when you use operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, or when you call built-in functions like `len()`, `str()`, or `repr()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Python [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names):\n",
    "> A class can implement certain operations that are invoked by special syntax (such as arithmetic operations or subscripting and slicing) by defining methods with special names. This is Pythonâ€™s approach to **operator overloading**, allowing classes to define their own behavior with respect to language operators. For instance, if a class defines a method named `__getitem__()`, and `x` is an instance of this class, then `x[i]` is roughly equivalent to `type(x).__getitem__(x, i)`. Except where mentioned, attempts to execute an operation raise an exception when no appropriate method is defined (typically `AttributeError` or `TypeError`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We already met the `__init__()` method, which is called when an object is created. Here are some other special methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__str__(self)` - called by the `str()` built-in function and by the `print()` function to compute the \"informal\" or nicely printable string representation of an object.\n",
    "* `__repr__(self)` - called by the `repr()` built-in function to compute the \"official\" string representation of an object.\n",
    "* `__len__(self)` - called by the `len()` built-in function to compute the length of a sequence.\n",
    "* `__add__(self, other)` - called by the `+` operator to compute the sum of two objects.\n",
    "* `__call__(self, *args, **kwargs)` - called when an instance of the class is called as a function.\n",
    "* and many more... \n",

The `__repr__()` method is called by the `repr()` built-in function to compute the \"official\" string representation of an object.
